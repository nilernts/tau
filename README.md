# What is Tau?

Tau introduces a next-gen decentralized exchange providing liquidity, and enabling peer-to-peer transactions on the [Flow network](https://flow.com). Tau allows users to trade directly from their wallets rather than through a 3rd-party -- your tokens never leave your custody, and are 100% owned by you. Further, low trading fees and high liquidity makes Tau an attractive platform to trade with, and also helps provide a broad range of support to various facets of the Flow community -- to continuously adapt to the changing markets by continuing to provide value to both token holders and the community. Tau provides the following features:

1. High-efficiency swapping
2. Capital-efficient Lending & Borrowing Protocol
3. Secure Cross-chain Bridge


# 1. High-efficiency Swapping

Quickly swap crypto tokens on Flow. Tau's implementation of [Uniswap v2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2) entirely written in [Cadence](https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language/index) makes for a highly-efficient DEX experience. You can also add liquidity to the various pools supported to further strengthen the protocol.
