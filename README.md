# What is Tau?

Tau introduces a next-gen decentralized exchange providing liquidity, and enabling peer-to-peer transactions on the [Flow network](https://flow.com). Tau allows users to trade directly from their wallets rather than through a 3rd-party -- your tokens never leave your custody, and are 100% owned by you. Further, low trading fees and high liquidity makes Tau an attractive platform to trade with, and also helps provide a broad range of support to various facets of the Flow community -- to continuously adapt to the changing markets by continuing to provide value to both token holders and the community. Tau provides the following features:

1. High-efficiency swapping
2. Capital-efficient Lending & Borrowing Protocol
3. Secure Cross-chain Bridge


# 1. High-efficiency Swapping

Quickly swap crypto tokens on Flow. Tau's implementation of [Uniswap v2](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2) entirely written in [Cadence](https://developers.flow.com/cadence/language/index) makes for a highly-efficient DEX experience. You can also add liquidity to the various pools supported to further strengthen the protocol.

# 2. Lending & Borrowing

Tau introduces an institution-grade DeFi borrowing and lending protocol featuring ***permissionless*** liquidity pools, allowing anyone to lend and borrow assets at high APYs.


### Some points

1. Borrowers pay 0.1% of the borrowed amount as an "origination" fee, which is added to the total borrow amount in its respective token.
2. Liquidations carry a 10% fee paid directly to the liquidator.
3. All transactions occur on the [Flow Network](https://flow.com).

# 3. Cross-Chain Bridge

Tau has a cross-chain bridge to facilitate interoperability between Flow and other chains (such as Polygon). Currently, Tau supports Flow <=> Polygon Mumbai, with more chains being supported very soon. Tau's bridge is permissionless, and allows anyone to bridge assets between the two chains, regardless of EVM-compatibility or not. That is, it is possible to bridge assets from Flow to, say, Solana devnet and vice-versa.
